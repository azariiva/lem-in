*School 42 algorithmic project*

The goal of this project is to find the quickest way to get n ants from start point to end point.

Field is described as a set of rooms each has a capacity and can be connected to another.

I've modified Edmonds Karp algorithm to solve this task: instead of edges each node has weight.
